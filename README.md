# Bound
 
Bound was a prototype worked on by 2 programmers, 3 artists, and 1 sound engineer in Unity using C#. This game followed the themes of Minimalism and One-Button. This prototype was done over 1 week.

The team included myself, Eloise Carr, Calliope Ryder (@callioperyder), Ben Walden, Jacob Copper, and Chris Hodgson.

The objective is for the player to get the ball into the goal. The direction is chosen from where the controller is on the outside ring. There are 5 levels in this prototype, each increasing in difficulty.
